# Chess Data Pipeline

## Overview
This project is part of a larger personal project to build a chess engine using C, C++, and Machine Learning.  
The goal of this module is to process the Lichess game database (in `.pgn.zst` format) and transform it into a machine-learning-friendly CSV format.

## Purpose
Extract relevant training data for a machine learning model that predicts chess moves.  
The CSV format, referred to as **FEN+**, will include one row per move and contain:

- **Time Format** - String representing the game time limit and if there are any increments. (e.g. `10` for 10 minutes or `10+3` for a 10 minute game where each move buys 3 more seconds to the clock)
- **Move Number** â€” integer indicating which move in the game this is.
- **FEN** â€” board state before the move (standard Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation).
- **ELO** â€” Lichess rating of the player who made the move.
- **Next Move** â€” the move taken from the FEN position, represented in **UCI** notation (e.g. `e2e4`).

## Input
- File format: `.pgn.zst` (Lichess compressed PGN dump)
- Each file contains multiple games in PGN format.

## Output
- CSV file containing rows in the format: time_format,move_number,fen,elo,uci_move

## Dependencies
- `libzstd`: for reading `.zst` files inline

## Development Goals
- ðŸš§ Efficient streaming of large `.zst` files without full decompression
- ðŸš§ Accurate PGN parsing
- ðŸš§ Clean and modular C implementation
- ðŸš§ FEN state generator
- ðŸš§ CSV writer with UCI move annotations
- ðŸš§ Unit tests and benchmarks
